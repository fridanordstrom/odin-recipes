        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A semla is a delicious Swedish cardamom-scented, buttery bun filled with 
            sweet almond paste and fluffy whipped cream. Semlor buns are 
            traditionally eaten the day before the start of Lent, but they are so 
            enjoyable that I suggest you make them anytime!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 semla buns</li>
            <li>14 ounces almond paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine almond paste, powdered sugar, milk, and cardamom in a food 
                processor and blend almond filling until smooth. 
            </li>
            <li>Cut a triangle from the top of the buns, and remove some of the 
                crumbs to make room for the filling. Pipe almond filling into each 
                bun, and top with whipped cream. Place the triangle on top and 
                dust with powdered sugar before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
